# Python_practice_program

This repository contains a collection of basic Python programs designed for practicing fundamental programming concepts such as user input, loops, conditionals, and mathematical operations.

## Programs Included
Each program is implemented as a function and can be selected from a menu-based interface.

### Program List

5. Quotient with Decimal - Computes and prints the quotient of two numbers with decimal formatting.
6. Exponentiation - Raises the first number to the power of the second number.
7. Sum of Ten Numbers - Asks the user to input 10 numbers and prints their sum.
8. Count Odd Numbers - Asks the user to input 10 numbers and counts how many are odd.
9. Print Even Numbers (0-100) - Prints all even numbers from 0 to 100 using a for loop.
