# Python_practice_program

This repository contains a collection of basic Python programs designed for practicing fundamental programming concepts such as user input, loops, conditionals, and mathematical operations.

## Programs Included
Each program is implemented as a function and can be selected from a menu-based interface.

## Features  
- ✅ Menu-based selection for easy navigation  
- ✅ Handles **user input** and **validations**  
- ✅ Uses **loops and conditional statements** for logic implementation  
- ✅ Covers fundamental **Python operations** 

### Program List
#### Batch 1

1. **Compare Two Numbers** - Asks the user for two numbers and prints the larger one.
2. **Check Equality** - Checks if two input numbers are equal.
3. **Sum of Two Numbers** - Computes and prints the sum of two numbers.
4. **Product of Two Numbers** - Computes and prints the product of two numbers.
5. **Quotient with Decimal** - Computes and prints the quotient of two numbers with decimal formatting.
6. **Exponentiation** - Raises the first number to the power of the second number.
7. **Sum of Ten Numbers** - Asks the user to input 10 numbers and prints their sum.
8. **Count Odd Numbers** - Asks the user to input 10 numbers and counts how many are odd.
9. **Print Even Numbers** (0-100) - Prints all even numbers from 0 to 100 using a for loop.
10. **Skip Multiples of 10** - Prints numbers from 0 to 100, skipping numbers ending in zero.

#### Batch 2

1. **Find the Smaller Number** – Accepts two numbers and prints the smaller one.  
2. **Check for Inequality** – Checks if two numbers are **not equal**.  
3. **Calculate the Difference** – Computes the **difference** between two numbers.  
4. **Quotient without Decimal** – Divides two numbers and removes decimal places.  
5. **Find the Remainder** – Computes the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.  
6. **Subtract Multiple Numbers** – The first number is subtracted by the sum of the next **9 numbers**.  
7. **Count Even Numbers** – Asks for **10 numbers** and counts how many are even.  
8. **Print Odd Numbers (0-100)** – Displays all odd numbers from **0 to 100** using a while loop.  
9. **Skip Numbers Ending in 0 and 5** – Prints numbers from **0 to 100**, skipping those ending in 0 or 5.  
10. **Print Numbers Between Two Inputs** – Displays all numbers between two user-inputted values.
